%ARC  Adjusted Ratio of Clustering.
%
% ARC quantifies the degree of clustering in a recall sequence.
% ARC = (R - E(R)) / (maxR - E(R)), where R is the total number of
% observed category repetitions, maxR is the maximum number of possible
% category repetitions, and E(R) is the expected number of chance
% repetitions. Based on Roenker et al., 1971.
%
% arc_scores = arc(catrecall_matrix, subjects, mask);
%
% INPUTS:
% catrecalls_matrix:  a matrix whose elements are the category
%                     identities of recalled items.  The rows of
%                     this matrix should represent recalls made by
%                     a single subject on a single trial.  After
%                     all valid recalls, the terminal positions
%                     should be filled by negative values, which
%                     will be masked.
% 
%          subjects:  a column vector which indexes the rows of
%                     catrecalls_matrix with a subject number (or
%                     other identifier).  That is, the recall
%                     trials of subject S should be located in
%                     catrecalls_matrix(find(subjects==S), :) 
%
% OUTPUTS:
%        arc_scores:  a vector of scores.  Each score is the mean
%                     arc score for a particular subject.
%
% EXAMPLES:
% >> catrecalls_matrix = [0 1 1 1 2 1 0 0 NaN NaN NaN; ...
%                         2 2 2 1 1 0 1 NaN NaN NaN NaN];
% >> subjects = [1; 2];
% >> arc_scores = arc(catrecall_matrix, subjects);
